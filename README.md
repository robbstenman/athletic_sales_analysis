Issue: In the instructions under 'Combine and Clean the Data', it says: "Combine the two DataFrames by the rows using an inner join, and reset the index." It then provides a hint that says "Read over the instructions to determine if you should use concat, join, or merge." This caused me some confusion as the term 'inner join' means I should use the 'merge' function.  I used the 'merge' function, but it resulted in every column beind duplicated with a _x or _y.  This result did not allow me to proceed.  I checked with the Xpert Learning Assistand and the AskBCS Learning Assistant and received conflicting responses.  After trying various ways to tackle this issue, I ended up using 'concat' with an inner join.
