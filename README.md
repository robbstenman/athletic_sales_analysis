Issue: In the instructions under 'Combine and Clean the Data', it says: "Combine the two DataFrames by the rows using an inner join, and reset the index." It then provides a hint that says "Read over the instructions to determine if you should use concat, join, or merge." This caused me some confusion as the term 'inner join' means I should use the merge function.  Had the instruction not specifically said to use 'an inner join', I would have used the concat function, which would have produced better (easier to read) results.
